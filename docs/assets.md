# Asset provenance

Every third-party asset in this repo must be CC0 (public domain) and recorded
here: pack name, author, source URL, and license confirmation. New asset work
appends a new section below — don't restructure existing sections, since
multiple issues add to this file independently.

## Sprite packs

Used for the combat scene's player and Monster sprites (`src/ui/sprites.ts`,
`src/assets/sprites/`). All source images are pixel art rendered with
`image-rendering: pixelated` at a shared on-screen size, and given a subtle
CSS idle bob (`.sprite` in `src/styles.css`) rather than shipping per-pack
animation frames, so packs of different native resolutions still read as one
scene.

  released assets to the public domain; confirmed on the pack's page.
- **Goblin Free Pixelart** (thekingphoenix, CC0): 32×32 idle/run/attack/death
  animation set; `src/assets/sprites/goblin.png` is the first frame of the
  front-facing idle animation. Confirmed CC0 on the OpenGameArt submission
